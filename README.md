Overview: Dùng Transformer + Neural Module Net để thực hiện "visual reasoning" trên ảnh, map với text bằng Co-Attention để ra trajectory-goal distribution, rồi feed qua control system bằng Reinforcement Learning (lười viết tiếng anh quá)


1. DestinationsTuple: 
Implementing visual reasoning based on this paper :https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00804.pdf (ProTo). The purpose is locating the pivot and relation
for better destination navigation.
For example: "Fly to the left of the man wearing red T-shirt" 
  + pivot: : "the man wearing red T-shirt"
  + relation : "left"

The model can also answer visual questions.



2. TrajectoryGenerator:
From the set of tuples generated by the ProTo and the pose from the drones, generate trajectory/ goal distribution map that the drone will fly.
The distribution map will go to the second stage (Control System) from this paper: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~valts/docs/blukis_corl19.pdf
